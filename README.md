Hi, I’m @TjorbenH,
I'm currently 15 years old and started learning python about one year ago. Since then I have built a bunch of small and fun projects.
I'm mainly focussing on properly learning all the important generall concepts and strategies to become a good software dev. 
I’m currently learning Python and my latest Project is a little discord bot, that I'm  going to puplish in the next couple of months.
